# Shunt-GRU-diagnosis-of-epileptic-seizure
This project designed a new recurrent neural network structure for EEG classification to diagnose whether there is epilepsy. In order to prevent over-fitting, we adopted K-fold cross-validation technology.Our seizure identification dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition

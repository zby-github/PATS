# PATS: A New Neural Network Activation Function with Parameter
The project is used to test the PATS activation function. All network models are built in Python 3.6.7 environment based on Keras 2.2.4 neural network framework. Before running the code in the project, you need to download the cifar-10 / 100 dataset from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
